        text: "Preliminary global average temperatures taken so far in June are nearly 1C (1.8F) above levels previously recorded for the same month, going back to 1979. While the month is not yet complete and may not set a new June record, climate scientists say it follows a pattern of strengthening global heating that could see this year named the hottest ever recorded, topping 2016. The long-term warming conditions caused by the burning of fossil fuels will likely receive a further pulse of heat via El Niño, a naturally reoccurring phenomenon where sections of the Pacific Ocean heat up, typically causing temperatures to spike across the world. According to the text, which one of the following is true?",
        options: ["The June temperature this year is consistent with an observed trend.", "This year, June will be the hottest month on record since 1979.", "Temperatures in June are not related to the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon.", "June 1979 was the hottest month to date.", "The El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon limits the effects of burning fossil fuels."],

        text: "There is a commonly held belief, known as the ‘Matthew effect', that students who start with poor academic attainment early in school make less progress over time than their higher-achieving peers. But recent research has shed new light on this topic. A study examined patterns of growth in literacy and numeracy among more than 150,000 young people in Australia. Researchers tested pupils regularly between year 3 and year 9. They found that students who began with high achievement in reading and numeracy tests in year 3 were not making the amount of progress to year 9 of which they were capable. On the other hand, students starting with below average test scores made more progress from year 3 to year 9 than students starting above average. This compensatory growth pattern was seen in both reading and numeracy but was especially significant in reading. Which one of the following can be drawn as a conclusion from the above passage?",
