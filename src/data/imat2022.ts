        text: "Individuals accept deliberate harm being done to human beings and other living creatures for a variety of reasons. Whether it is self-defence, the need to kill animals for food, or some other reason, many – if not most – people who consider themselves to have ‘good morals’ will generally agree to the intentional killing of other beings if there is adequate justification for doing so. However, one cannot justify killing without complete knowledge of what those who are killed go through. Thus, people who choose to eat meat should find out about how the animals they consume are reared and killed. Otherwise, people cannot truly accept full responsibility for their decision-making. Which one of the following best illustrates the principle used in the above argument?",
        options: ["Citizens who support imposing the death penalty in some criminal cases should educate themselves about the procedures used to administer it.", "A lawyer prosecuting an individual for murder should be aware of any serious difficulties in the life of the defendant in the years leading up to the crime.", "Scientists who use dead animal specimens for the purpose of an experiment should be certain there are no alternative research methods available.", "Farmers who need to kill crop-eating insects should find out which pesticides are the least harmful to other kinds of wildlife.", "A police officer who accidentally kills someone in the line of duty should be willing to tell the victim’s family about the circumstances of the death."],
