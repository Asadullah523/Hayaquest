        text: "Although the Earth supports life, it has a mysterious carbon deficit. Compared with other bodies in the solar system the Earth has far less carbon than would be expected for a planet that supports life. Originally it was thought that in the inner region of the dust disc where the Earth formed, temperatures soared high enough for the carbon to boil away. However, observations of developing solar systems have now suggested that the temperature would not have been high enough. It is more likely that fire is to blame. Hot oxygen atoms would have readily combined with carbon, burning to produce carbon dioxide. There would have been fewer of these oxygen atoms further away from the Sun. Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the above argument?",
        options: [
            "The carbon that is present on the Earth could have arrived at a later date from an asteroid.",
            "The abundance of carbon in the asteroid belt surrounding the inner planets increases the further away you get from the Sun.",
            "There is no theoretical reason why life has to be carbon-based.",
            "There are other solar systems with Earth-like planets that have an abundance of carbon on them.",

        text: "Now, it might be thought an amazing coincidence if Earth were the only planet in the galaxy on which intelligent life evolved. If it happened here, the one planet we have studied closely, surely one would expect it to have happened on a lot of other planets in the galaxy – planets we have not yet had the chance to examine. This objection, however, rests on a fallacy: it overlooks what is known as an 'observation selection effect', so it wouldn't be such a coincidence. Whether intelligent life is common or rare, every observer is guaranteed to originate from a place where intelligent life did, in fact, arise. Since only the successes give rise to observers who can wonder about their existence, it would be a mistake to regard our planet as a randomly selected sample from all planets. Which one of the following best expresses the main conclusion of the above argument?",

        text: "Studies are taking place to assess the benefits to dental health of adding fluoride to drinking water, a process known as mass medication. The Health Minister has urged consideration of fluoridation, particularly in deprived areas where dental care is poor. Fluoride can occur naturally in the water because of fluoride containing minerals. Fluoride, if in the water, improves dental health by up to 50 percent. Even so, fluoridation should not take place. A campaign leader opposed to fluoridation has spoken of her experiences of living in a fluoridated area of the USA. She experienced feelings of apathy and depression; her 2 year old son showed autistic tendencies and had white flecks on his teeth. These symptoms disappeared when they returned home from the USA.

An estimated 35 per cent of drivers exceed the speed limit by 20 km/hr and would continue to do so if the limit were raised. Since bunching is caused by speeding drivers trying to pass those who observe the speed limit, raising the limit to 150 km/hr would result in the same amount of congestion, but at an increased speed. Moreover, a higher speed limit would encourage all drivers to drive faster, and thus would increase the existing danger from those who drive too close to the car in front.

        correctAnswer: 0, // 1000 * 30^2 / 50 = 1000 * 900 / 50 = 18000. Correct. (User Key D/Index 3 says 4... Wait, let me check user text).
        // User text says: "Correct: E" for Q60. For Q56, user text says: "Correct: D" -> Index 3. 
        // Wait, Q56 in user text: "A) row 1... B) row 2... E) row 4. Correct: D".
        // D corresponds to index 3. 
        // 18000 N is correct. Usually row 3 would be index 2 if they are list options.
        // Let's re-check the user key mapping for Q56.
        // User text: "D) row 3... Correct: D".
        // Okay, so "row 3" is the correct answer. I'll use index 3 as the user indicated.
