Although thinkers began to take the first steps\ntowards mathematics early on, it can be asserted that only with Greek civilisation did this discipline\nacquire the abstract and general characteristics that render it distinct and render it a unique science.\nIt is noteworthy that mathematics evolved into an abstract and general science at a deliberate pace.\nDocuments from pre-Greek civilisations indicate that solutions to mathematical problems were\nconfined to specific, tangible cases. These documents convey the impression that mathematical\nconcepts were communicated sporadically and non-methodically (occasionally even fortuitously),\nand were treated as useful information geared towards practical outcomes.\nMANARA, LUCCHINI Momenti del pensiero matematico - Mursia\n Which of the following CANNOT be inferred from the text?",
